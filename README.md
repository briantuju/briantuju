# Brian Tuju

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building user-centric applications. I have extensive knowledge in JavaScript programming language, in addition to modern libraries such as React and its ecosystem. I also have a working knowledge of back-end technologies, which enables me to develop full stack systems.
